### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on courses and curriculum for Girl Develop It as well as hosting podcasts for Hacking With The Homies Developer Conference and trainX.ai.

🎥 I live stream my personal projects and AI learning journey and post other technical videos on [youtube.com/@metadevgirl](https://youtube.com/@metadevgirl) (or you can follow me on [twitch.tv/metadevgirl](https://twitch.tv/metadevgirl)).

🐣 You can join my Discord server for our community ["The Nerdsery"](https://discord.gg/z8puRNC) where we post tech and education resources, talk industry topics, and chitchat outside of live streams.

🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and AI. I'm particularly interested in NLP as I am heading back to academia to pursue research and a Ph.D in Computer Science.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source curriculum.

🤔 I’m looking for help with podcast guests on AI and other technical topics or volunteers for the [Hacking with the Homies Developer Conference](https://hackingwiththehomies.org)

💬 Ask me about bootcamps and beginner coding classes or how to grow in your career as an entry-level developer.

📫 How to reach me: jeseekia@metadevgirl.com or just [join my newletter](https://metadevgirl.com) for all the updates on classes and resources I create!
